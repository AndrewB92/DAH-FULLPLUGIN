# DAH Next.js Booking Plugin

This plugin embeds the built Next.js booking application via WordPress shortcodes.

Place the compiled assets from the Next.js project in the `build` directory.

## Shortcodes
- `[dah_booking_calendar]` – Renders the calendar component.
- `[dah_prepayment_page]` – Shows the prepayment screen.
- `[dah_payment_page]` – Shows the payment screen.

Each shortcode enqueues `build/app.js`, which must be generated by running `next build` and `next export` in the Next.js project.
